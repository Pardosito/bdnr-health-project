# Health System Project

## Project by:

- José Alfredo Calvillo Gómez

## Description
This is a system designed for medical offices with specialized doctors. The idea is for these offices to be able to register their doctors, as well as their patients and have medical records for each of them. The system will also allow for doctors to keep real-time information of their consultations, like diagnosis or particular treatments. It will also allow for the doctors to identify special patterns such as second-hand recommendations for patients or identify irregular medication recommendations, among others.

This is meant to aliviate from unnecesary pain dealing with old-fashioned systems and applications, and to help them focus in what really matters.

## Workflow
### Populate data
To make use of this project, first run the populate.py file to make sure each DB has data to run any potential query.

## Queries
To make queries, run the main.py file to have access to all DBs and to the menu, which will offer a diversity of options according to each DB and the specific queries that will be available
